<h1 align="center">FireBlock for Firefox</h1>

FireBlock is a simple addon that blocks sites based on regexes. 
There's not much else to say about it, really. Simply add a few
regexes in the settings and away you fly. Every time you visit
a site that matches it, it well step in and let you know.

Great for focus. Great for productivity. Minimal.

The logo is just cool. This addon is in no way affiliated with 
Firefox or mozilla in any professional capacity.
